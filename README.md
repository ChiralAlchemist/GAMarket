# GAMarket
The goal of GAMarket will be to have an all-encompassing video game distribution platform. This will include video games from all platforms such as PlayStation, Nintendo, Xbox, mobile games, and desktop games. GAMarket will come with features such as a friend system, chat system, profile system, and many more. Java and JavaFX will be the main language used in this project, along with a small touch of SQL for database querying if possible.
